# VIA Metropolitan Transit Information
<p>
    Although VIA provides a lot of information for riders, there is some information that remains obscure.
</p>

## Lineup Timetables
<p>
    When VIA <a target="_blank" href="https://viainfo.net/servicechanges">announces service changes</a> that affect lineup scheduling, new timetables will be uploaded here as fast as I can create them.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, most of the lineup schedules haven't been created yet. These are the schedules that are currently being worked on:
</p>

- 202 [2 Lineup] - Blanco Lineup
- 214 [14-17 Lineup] - Austin Highway / Randolph Lineup Skip
- 222 [22-24 Lineup] - Hays / East Houston Lineup
- 276 [76-64 Lineup] - Commerce / Kel-Lac Transit Center Lineup Skip

<p>
    Completed schedules are linked below.
</p>

<p>
    <em>These schedules were last updated on May 5, 2025 to reflect the latest service changes on August 19, 2024.</em>

### Schedules optimized for web viewing
<p>
    For simply viewing the lineup schedules, these are the recommended schedules.

### Schedules optimized for printing
<p>
    All schedules below can be easily printed on a standard piece of US letter paper (8.5 x 11 inches). The solid lines are fold lines, and the broken lines are cut lines.

### Schedules optimized for printing in grayscale
<p>
    For those who use a printer that only prints in black and white (such as myself), these are the schedules you'll want to use since the colored schedules don't provide enough contrast when printed out in grayscale. All schedules below can be easily printed on a standard piece of US letter paper (8.5 x 11 inches). The solid lines are fold lines, and the broken lines are cut lines.

    Upon updating lineup schedules, the older versions will still be available for viewing down below.<br/><br/>
