            <h1>VIA Lineup Timetables</h1>
            <p>
                <em>These schedules were last updated on July 18, 2025 to reflect the latest service changes on August 19, 2024.</em>
            </p>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                Lineup is a service that VIA operates every night, with buses departing the Downtown Service Hub
                (near Travis Park) at 10:30pm, 11:30pm, and 12:30am to give riders a final chance to make transfers
                and reach their final destinations. VIA, however, does not provide dedicated timetables for
                lineup routes, instead scattering the times across their regular daytime timetables.
                This page contains custom timetables that I have made for routes 202â€“296 in the style of their
                daytime schedules as a convenient alternative to VIA's brochures.
            </p>
            <p>
                When VIA <a target="_blank" href="https://viainfo.net/servicechanges">announces service changes</a> that
                affect lineup scheduling, new timetables will be uploaded here as fast as I can create them. The next service changes will
                go into effect on <b>August 18, 2025</b>.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                Due to the upcoming introduction of the new <a style="color: #b93838;" href="https://www.viainfo.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0818-Improvement-Map-Route-010-scaled.jpg" target="_blank">Route 10 (Nacogdoches Skip)</a> that is expected to run until
                12:30am every day, be aware that every schedule will likely need to be updated to add it to the list of Downtown transfers.
            </p>

            Expect every error to be fixed within a few days of VIA releasing the schedules for the upcoming service changes.<br/><br/>

            <li>[Error 202]: <b>Point A</b> on the Southbound side of the timetable should be labeled as <b>"St. Mary's & Martin"</b>.</li>

            <li>[Error 225]: <b>Route 209</b> is missing from the Downtown Service Hub transfer list.</li>
            <li>[Error 230]: Immediately north of <b>Point A</b>, the bus is mistakenly portrayed as turning left on Pecan Street.
                 This should be corrected to a left turn on <b>Martin Street</b> instead.
